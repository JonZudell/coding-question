# coding-question
Hello thanks for taking a moment to look over what I've written up.

I've included two seperate examples one in lua and one in python with different approaches.
If I have enough free time I may include a minimalist command line java implementation and add some unit tests / additional functionality.

# LUA
For the LUA version I decided to use the https://love2d.org/ framework. 
I've been getting more into lua lately so I figured I'd take a crack at it and approach the problem from a desktop GUI point of view.

# Python
For the python version I decided to use my favorite web development framework Flask. 
I've temporarily hosted it at 107.170,255.215:5000

# TODOs
Unit test for flask
Select match type based on input
Add javascript and hit the json endpoints for progressive enhancement
implement click selection for lua
